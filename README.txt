Description:
This repository contains implementations of multiple algorithms for sleep stage prediction using EEG (Electroencephalography) data. The goal is to utilize the LSTM neural network output to accurately produce binaural frequencies that increase restfullness and improve quality of sleep.

Datasets:
The repository includes datasets used for training and testing the algorithms. These datasets contain EEG data recorded during sleep sessions along with corresponding sleep stage annotations. Each dataset is preprocessed and formatted to be compatible with the algorithms.
